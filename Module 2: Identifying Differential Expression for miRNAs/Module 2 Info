This module comes with one R shiny script "Identifying_Differential_Expression.R" which takes in an input list of miRNA names as well as data about miRNA expression and finds information using the expression data about the differential expression of each miRNA between tumor and normal samples based on TCGA data, as well as where the experimental data came from. The miRNA list consists of mature miRNA sequences that are in seperate lines, as can be seen in the example file "BLCA_miRNA_list.txt". This program uses data from dbDEMC that can be used to find differential expression information, which is in the 28.5 MB file "miRExpAll.txt.zip". After inputting the miRNA list as well as the expression data, the program should output the desired information.
