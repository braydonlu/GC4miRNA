# GC4miRNA
## Overview
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small RNA molecules that play a crucial role in regulating gene expression by binding to and degrading targeted mRNAs. Alterations in the binding site between miRNAs and mRNAs can lead to the dysregulation of genes, and a variety of diseases, including cancers. GC content is an important factor in miRNA binding, since high GC content miRNAs are often more stable and may have a stronger affinity for their targets. To reveal the GC content signature for cancer-associated miRNAs, we developed a R Shiny app called GC4miRNA, which calculates GC enrichment and performs statistical analysis for targeting miRNAs and their seed sequences using customized BASH and R scripts.
